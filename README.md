# FoodDiaryiOS

app that can capture photos of your favourite image & information about what you eat

# What did I learn

1. Utilise Apple Core Data Framework to save user data at local storage (Create,Delete,Update,Retrieve)
2. Request Camera access from user to capture food images
3. Utilise TabBarController to navigate user to certain screen
4. Take advantage of .xib file to customize TableViewCell
5. Manage to add interaction when user selects items at TableViewCell
6. Create constants files to store string & prevent error typo
7. Analyse & design the app prototype before start development for reference
